 *
 * This effect acts like a waveform monitor on each line.
 * It was originally done by deflecting the electron beam on a monitor using
 * additional electromagnets on the yoke of a b/w CRT. Here it is emulated digitally.

 * Experimental tapes were made with this system by Bill and Louise Etra and Woody and Steina Vasulka

 * The line spacing can be controlled using the 1 and 2 Keys.
 * The gain is controlled using the 3 and 4 keys.
 * The update rate is controlled using the 0 and - keys.
